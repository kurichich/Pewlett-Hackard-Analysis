# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explains the updates made to the PlanMyTrip app.  
- A weather description column was added to existing city data, through the use of an API call to the Open Weather website.
- Functionality was added for a user to input a temperature range to filter the data for their weather preferences, \
    which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.
- From a list of cities filtered by temperature preference, the user can select 4 cities to create a travel itinerary.
- A travel route between cities, as well as a marker layer map, can be created using Google Maps Direction API.
